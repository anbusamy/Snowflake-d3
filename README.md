# D3 Tree Visualization for Snowflake Roles

## Description
This project visualizes Snowflake roles and their hierarchical relationships using a collapsible D3 tree structure. It provides an interactive way to explore role-based access control in Snowflake.

## Features
- Dynamic D3.js tree visualization.
- Expandable and collapsible nodes for better navigation.
- Easy integration with Snowflake role data.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Snowflake Connector (if applicable for data fetching)

## Setup and Usage

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd d3-tree-visualization
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the visualization.

## File Structure
- `src/data`: Contains the data files for the D3 tree.
- `src/components`: React components for rendering the tree.
- `src/styles`: CSS files for styling the visualization.

## Example Output
Below is an example of the D3 tree visualization:
